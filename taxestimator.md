Tax Estimator
A simple tax estimator with a terminal user interface.
Uses the java.io.File class in conjunction with the Scanner class to read in tax information from a text file, taxrate.txt. As a result, adherence to the format in the text file is paramount.

It takes in the tax year, gross income and tax-filing status from the user, and returns tax amount and effective tax rate, assuming the user does not get any tax credit or deduction.

Next Steps:
-Refactoring
-Adding more tax data 
-Adding functionality to facor in deductions or credits.
-Employing the GUI Swing class

*As always suggestions for improvement welcome.
